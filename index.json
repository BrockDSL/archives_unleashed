[{"content":"Theory and Questions of the Archives Unleashed Niagara Region COVID-19 Dataset In this Archives Unleashed project, our team will be analyzing the Niagara Region COVID-19 dataset from the perspective of crisis communication theory. Crisis communication is a relatively young field by most standards, extending back just about 30 years. Back then, crisis communication researchers began with small-scale case studies of response messaging from individual organizations. The main question was this: Did the organization respond effectively to a crisis? If not, what could the organization have done better?\n\nToday, one trend in the field is towards computational analysis of very large datasets to go beyond the study of the individual organizational case. Looking at broader datasets can make eventual findings more significant – it’s not just one case. Our Niagara Region COVID-19 dataset is so big – gigabytes of website and social media data from many regional organizations – that computational analysis allows us to deal with and examine crisis messaging more systematically and on a broader scale. This analysis allows us to ask all kinds of important questions of the dataset and come to new, significant conclusions that further crisis communication theory. In turn, we hope practitioners can use these findings to deal effectively with the next mega crisis.\n\nBut first we have to ask questions that link past crisis communication theory with our dataset. Past research in the field on these mega crises falls into a few main themes:\n how crisis communication messaging contributes to community resilience; the development of public trust; education about and compliance with public health recommendations; public engagement with organizations. Researchers have also considered the factor of emotions in public messaging and messaging consistency and congruence during mega crises.   With these themes in mind, here are some of the questions we’re thinking about asking of the Niagara Region COVID-19 dataset:\n  Did private and public Niagara Region organizations communicate similar messages and advice to the public during the pandemic? Was there “one voice” across the region or diverging voices?\n  Was the purpose of communication instructional or emotional?\n  If the messages were instructional, were the instructions consistent across organizations (re. masking, social distancing, vaccination etc.)?\n  Did organizational messaging change over time in terms of content and emotional sentiment?\n  Were messages to the public simple or complicated?\n  How much of the message content was about organizational status versus community building?\n  Did organizations foreground messages from their leaders? Or did they speak as a ‘faceless’ organization?\n  Did organizations tell stories about the pandemic or just stick to the facts about COVID-19?\n  Did the emotions of the messages change over time, reflecting developments in the pandemic?\n  \nThese questions are exploratory in nature and quite broad at this time. But in the near future, as we start to dig into the dataset, we’ll be able to determine whether the questions can be answered at all. Most likely, computational analysis will favour some questions over others, and we can start moving more fully in a few of these directions. And those findings should provide some interesting, useful guidance for public relations practitioners, perhaps even as the pandemic continues into the winter of 2022.\n\nDuncan Koerber is the author of Crisis Communication in Canada published by University of Toronto Press, and is available in the Brock Library Collection\n ","permalink":"https://brockdsl.github.io/archives_unleashed/posts/crisis-communication-theory/","summary":"An introduction to crisis communication and how it relates to the Niagara COVID-19 archive","title":"Crisis Communication Theory and Questions"},{"content":"The COVID-19 in Niagara Dataset Traditionally in the archival profession, records arrive in archives when they are no longer an active part of the day-to-day functions or needs of the creator. The materials still have informational, evidentiary, or historic value. Thus, these need to be preserved for long term access. Most often, such records come to the archives years after their active life. In today’s digital world, records can change quickly – day to day, even hour by hour. The need to capture and store this information effectively for future reference and study is important.\nWhen the COVID-19 outbreak came to Canada in mid-March 2020, websites became one of the primary sources for information about the virus. The messaging and reactions surrounding COVID-19 seemed to change daily. In April 2020, the Brock University Archives started to capture COVID-19 related webpages of major municipal governments, businesses, and organizations in the Niagara region of Canada using the web archiving tool Archive-It in an effort to save the evolving record of this area’s response to this historic pandemic.\nWe identified 56 key local institutions, governments, and organizations that needed to communicate their pandemic related messages to their clients, constituents, and patrons often. Each of these groups created a COVID-19 webpage on their websites. These webpages have been crawled and saved using Archive-It weekly since April 2020. Our intention is to continue to do so through the duration of all pandemic measures surrounding COVID-19. As of this writing, there has been over 3.3 million documents saved equaling 301 GB of data. Here are some samples:\nTo supplement this information, we have also collected local news stories about the pandemic.\nBecause Archive-It is a paid subscription service, there is a cap on the amount of allotted storage space that Brock gets every year. To manage our allotment, most of these webpages were captured at either the One Page or One Page+ setting depending on the amount of data the creator placed on their websites weekly. For the One Page setting, hyperlinks within the page may not lead to another webpage. For One Page+, the first page as well as the first page of any URLs directly linked off of your seed was archived. We also set a data limit to each webpage to ensure that a few content heavy webpages would not use all the storage space at the detriment of the rest. At the start of the pandemic, the weekly capture of information ranged from 5 - 11 GB. Since October 2020, the average has settled to 2 -3 GB per week.\nAfter managing this dataset over the past year and a half, I cannot wait to see the discoveries that lie within and the fine research that will be done.\n","permalink":"https://brockdsl.github.io/archives_unleashed/posts/the-dataset/","summary":"A brief overview of the dataset we are using","title":"The Dataset"},{"content":"The Project This website is dedicated to documenting the progress of the Brock University team as they work through the Archives Unleashed Cohort program. Over a series of blog posts we are hoping to tell the story of the project and share the outputs of our work.\nArchives Unleashed Archives Unleashed is a huge collaborative initiative that spans many different universities, governmental organizations, the Internet Archive, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Its primary mission is to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to researchers interested in studying the recent past.\nArchives Unleashed Cohort program One of the many projects Archives Unleashed is undertaking is a Cohort program. The goal of which is to facilitate research engagement with web archives. The Crisis Communication in Niagara project was a successful application for this grant. As we progress through all of the stages of our work we will document outcomes on this site and hopefully tell a story of not just our end results but all of the steps along the way. In total for this year five projects were selected for the Cohort program. A recent press release provides a great summary of those five.\nKick off Event Work officially began in mid-July with a start up event where all five groups presented their researcher plans. I encourage you to take a look at our slides for more details about what we are hoping to tackle. The two day session also included lots of chances for generative discussions about utilizing web archives in research, and a demo of a new tool project teams will be able to use to create derivatives from their larger web archives.\nWatch this space for more updates as we progress. Next step up is getting our research assistant lined up and preparing for an in-class activity ready for October.\n","permalink":"https://brockdsl.github.io/archives_unleashed/posts/introduction_to_the_project/","summary":"The Project This website is dedicated to documenting the progress of the Brock University team as they work through the Archives Unleashed Cohort program.
