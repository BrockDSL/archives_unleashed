For the One Page setting, hyperlinks within the page may not lead to another webpage. For One Page+, the first page as well as the first page of any URLs directly linked off of your seed was archived. We also set a data limit to each webpage to ensure that a few content heavy webpages would not use all the storage space at the detriment of the rest.

<p>Traditionally in the archival profession, records arrive in archives when they are no longer an active part of the day-to-day functions or needs of the creator.  The materials still have informational, evidentiary, or historic value.  Thus, these need to be preserved for long term access.  Most often, such records come to the archives years after their active life.  In today’s digital world, records can change quickly – day to day, even hour by hour.

<p>When the COVID-19 outbreak came to Canada in mid-March 2020, websites became one of the primary sources for information about the virus.
