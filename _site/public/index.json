[{"content":"The Project This website is dedicated to documenting the progress of the Brock University team as they work through the Archives Unleashed Cohort program. Over a series of blog posts we are hoping to tell the story of the project and share the outputs of our work.\nArchives Unleashed Archives Unleashed is a huge collaborative initiative that spans many different universities, governmental organizations, the Internet Archive, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. It\u0026rsquo;s primary mission is to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to researchers interested in studying the recent past.\nArchives Unleashed Cohort program One of the many projects Archives Unleashed is undertaking is a Cohort program. The goal of which is to facilitate research engagement with web archives. The Crisis Communication in Niagara project was a successful application for this grant. As we progress through all of the stages of our work we will document outcomes on this site and hopefully tell a story of not just our end results but all of the steps along the way. In total for this year five projects were selected for the Cohort program. A recent press release provides a great summary of those five.\nKick off Event Work officially began in min-July with a start up event where all five groups presented their researcher plans. I encourage you to take a look at our slides for more details about what we are hoping to tackle. The two day session also included lots of chances for generative discussions about utilizing web archives in research, and a demo of a new tool project teams will be able to use to create derivatives from their larger web archives.\nWatch this space for more updates as we progress. Next step up is getting our research assistant lined up and preparing for an in-class activity ready for October.\n","permalink":"/posts/introduction_to_the_project/","summary":"The Project This website is dedicated to documenting the progress of the Brock University team as they work through the Archives Unleashed Cohort program.

Analysis will focus on investigating three types of entities: local government, non-profit organizations, and major private entities. Findings from this research aim to inform future crisis communication organizational planning, specifically at the local and municipal level. The project will also create several open computational notebooks to support teaching, learning, and research.\nProject Team Tim Ribaric  David Sharron  Cal Murgu  Karen Louise Smith  Duncan Koerber   The Collection Datasets used to complete this project will mainly be derived from the COVID19 in Niagara Web Archive collection. This collection performs a weekly crawl of websites of major institutions, governments and organizations in the Niagara area focusing on the varied responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Further, one time crawls of newspaper articles focused on Niagara centric COVID-19 news. It is managed by the Brock University Archives and Special Collections.\nMethods Using Archive-It analysis tools, the team will create derivative files, such as full-text derivates, or url derivates, which will later be explored using other methods. Methods include text analysis techniques, such as sentiment and word frequency/tf-idf analysis, topic modelling to determine topic clusters, and close reading techniques.\nPartners This project is made possible by financial and technical support from the folks at the Archives Unleashed Project:\nIan Milligan (University of Waterloo)\nJefferson Bailey (Internet Archive)\nNick Ruest (York University)\nJimmy Lin (University of Waterloo)\nSamantha Fritz (University of Waterloo)\n","permalink":"/about/","summary":"Our goal Using web archives collected by Brock University, this project will examine how organizations in the Niagara region have responded to government COVID-19 mandates.
