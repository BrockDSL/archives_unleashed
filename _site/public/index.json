[{"content":"With the start of 2022 we\u0026rsquo;ve finally come to the point where we need to finish collecting our dataset and now start cleaning it up and analyzing it. One of our primary research goals is to see how different municipalities in the Niagara Region communicated COVID information on their webpages during the unfolding crisis. This of course is made possible by the wonderful dataset we are creating.\nEnter Google Colab Google Collabratory is Google\u0026rsquo;s answer to the Jupyter/IPython notebook. In short it is platform that allows you to create a webpage with embedded code snippets. Since it is build on Google infrastructure it ties in very nicely with Google Accounts, and it offers a Pro option that allows you to tap into more computing power. The great thing about Colab is that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to install any software on your local machine and sharing your results is as simple as collaborating on a Google Doc. One final thing worth pointing you is that you can save itertions of your notebooks directly to GitHub so they are even more accessible to the web. The Digital Scholarship Lab is a huge fan of sharing everything (data, teaching material, workshops) via GitHub.\nPreliminary Results As mentioned we decided that we would collect our web archive until end of December 2021 so that when we returned for the new year we\u0026rsquo;d turn our attention to scafolding up our analysis tools. To start with we restricted our dataset to the 14 municipalities in the Niagara regions. Here\u0026rsquo;s a graph showing how many URLS were captured.\nOnce we narrow down to a city we can drill down even farther to see the details about urls that were harvested. We even calculated some additional metrics on our full-text content:\n Page Length, simply is the number of characters that are in the full-text. When you notice a change to this number that means that content has been added or removed from the page. Sentiment Score, this is a fascinating measure that attempts to quantify the sentiment, or mood expressed, on the page. Specifically we are using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.  Plotting these two values for URL captures in the dataset is very satisfying.\nTry it yourself To no surprise, we have shared the notebook on our Github repository for this project. If you add it directly to your own Colab account you render any of the 14 municipalities data. The notebook offers a download of a constructed CSV file of your dataset.

Exploring the dimensions of crisis communication is a complex undertaking, even more so when numerous actors with varying messages, intentions, motivations, and degrees of style are present. To gain a better understanding of how this communication has occurred, the team will be pouring over 300 GBs of webpages archived during the pandemic.\nOne tool that we are looking to help explore such a large body of documents is Warclight, a web application and frontend for exploring web archives (WARCs) that have been indexed into Apache Solr. Solr is a powerful engine that allows for the efficient location of documents based on full-text search and facets but is difficult to use without firsthand knowledge of its query language. WARCs are an ISO 28500 standard file format developed to facilitate the archival of web pages. Information stored includes metadata such as the date and time of the request and the HTTP response, while the actual data can be HTML, images, videos, and other types of media. In the context of our own collection, we have tens of thousands of WARCs, which correspond to the \u0026ldquo;web crawls” of web pages that we are interested in examining. Warclight is necessary because even though technically these WARCs can be indexed into Solr, searching over the collection can be quite cumbersome without a convenient interface.\nOur current workflow is as follows: Archive-It! is used to archive web crawls of select websites from the Niagra region. This data is available in WARCs and can be downloaded using an exposed API and py-waspi-client. WARCs are then indexed into Solr using the UK Web Archive’s Web Archive Discovery Tool. Our instance of Warclight is hosted on Amazon AWS and is deployed using Ansible, a tool that makes routine system administrative tasks easier and more reliable. Using virtual machines and Ansible together, ensures that deployments are repeatable and fast. And while the setup of Warclight has been relatively straightforward, estimating the amount of space that will be necessary to index our entire collection of WARCs is still unknown. Nevertheless, it should be less than the total size of our WARC collection. Another open question is how long it will take to index the entirety of our WARCs into Solr from scratch.\n Components and services used Once Warclight has access to indexed WARCs, information discovery occurs in several ways. Facets are very useful for isolating data. Full text search is also useful for locating webpages based on keywords, phrases, or other textual linkages. Once results are found, metadata about an archive can pinpoint a user to further clues, such as when the data was archived, the host that was crawled, outbound links, and a link to a recent archive of the page - accomplished using the Momento Timetravel API.\n Available facets  Searching in Warclight   One perceived drawback of Warclight is that it does not have any methods for displaying the captured data, itself. If an image or video is provided as a search result, the user cannot view this media as it was captured and must replay on a Timetravel generated URL. Similarly for HTML data, only the raw extracted text is available, with the layout, images, CSS, and functionality stripped from the results. Here again, a Timetravel URL is used to view the original page. However, it is important to understand the limitations of using the Timetravel service, as it serves up captures created by other organizations, at temporal times closest to – and most importantly, not necessarily exactly – the time that a WARC was generated. This means that there may be at times inconsistencies with the raw data that Warclight shows and the provided web archive URL by the Timetravel service. Given that we have access to the actual WARCs and Warclight provides a reference to the WARC file that generated a search result, this hopefully should not prove to be a real issue.\nWe hope that Warclight will prove to be a robust and powerful tool for examining our web archives and that it will help use answer questions about how Covid-19 has been communicated within the Niagra region.\n About Warclight Warclight is released by the Archives Unleashed Project and was developed by Nick Ruest from York University Libraries, and Ian Milligan and Jimmy Lin from the University of Waterloo. Warclight in turn is based off Blacklight, a frontend interface for Solr, but adds support for browsing indexed WARC data. An online demo of Warclight is available at https://warclight.archivesunleashed.org/, that has several interesting collections to browse.\n","permalink":"https://brockdsl.github.io/archives_unleashed/posts/what-is-warclight/","summary":"An introduction to our use of the Warclight platform","title":"Warclight"},{"content":"At its core, the Crisis Communication in Niagara project is a research endeavor — we are attempting to analyze a segment of the web and derive meaning out of thousands of websites, text documents, images, and other file types. Many of us are also teachers; naturally, we have an interest in the pedagogical implications of presenting the web as a source of data.\nHow do we best introduce students with little or no background to this topic? To scratch this pedagogical itch, members of the team (Tim Ribaric, Cal Murgu, Karen Louise-Smith) developed a course module that reframes the web as a rich data source, rather than simply a medium to browse, explore, and consume. The a/synchronous module was featured in Dr. Karen Louise-Smith’s 4th Data and Society course. The learning objectives of the module were as follows:\n O1: Introduce students to the technical and ethical aspects of web archiving O2: Offer opportunities for students to experience web archives as users and as technicians  To meet these objectives, we created the module using a ‘flipped-classroom’ model: students completed an asynchronous lecture and a series of DIY activities in the LMS, followed by a synchronous ‘sensemaking’ session on October 20th.\nAhead of the ‘sensemaking’ session on October 20th, students were asked to read the following articles:\nMcCrow-Young, A. (2021). Approaching Instagram Data: Reflections on Accessing, Archiving, and Anonymising Visual Social Media. Communication Research and Practice, 7(1), 21-34.\nLin, J., Milligan, I., Oard, D. W., Ruest, N., and Shilton, K. (2020). We could, but should we? Ethical considerations for providing access to GeoCities and Other Historical Digital Collections. CHIIR \u0026lsquo;20: Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval , 135-144.\nThe recorded lecture (embedded below) covers the basics of web archives, including what they are, how they function, and why we should be interested in preserving the web. The lecture is bookended by the #freedaleaskey story, expertly described by Ian Milligan, Nick Ruest, and Anna St. Onge in their article in Digital Studies.\n Following the lecture, students were asked to complete a series of activities to meet the second objective. The first activity invited students to visit the WayBack machine and search for a website that is important to them. To visualize change over time, students had to explore three different snapshots of the same url and describe the changes that they observed in several sentences. As an example, snapshots of the Brock University website from 1999, 2007, and 2013 were shown.\nCirca 1997 Circa 2007 Circa 2013 Student responses gestured to the interesting information that we can derive from an analysis of how websites can change over time. For instance, a researcher may focus on branding and promotion efforts, or how product launches have changed in relation to the growth of the company.\nThe second activity asked students to assume the role of an analyst by exploring a computational notebook. The computational notebook was created in Google Colab by Tim Ribaric. The notebook features a variety of scripts that analyze crawl rates, top urls by crawl frequency, change of text on a page over time, and sentiment analysis using TextBlob. While students did not have to write any code, they had to run code chunks and interpret results, such as graphs and plots. In the concluding section of the notebook, students were asked to change a variable (the url of a page), and reflect on the subsequent analysis. Without question, this activity represented the most challenging task in this module.\nThe final activity required that students synthesize the entire lesson into a thoughtful response to the following question:\n Suppose that you’ve been asked to create a policy for web archiving Brock University’s Instagram posts given what you’ve read and experienced about Web Archives during this lesson. What are some essential elements that you would consider as you begin to craft this policy?\n In their responses, students cited interesting ethical issues surrounding Instagram posts, privacy concerns of those featured in posts, infrastructural considerations with respect to crawl frequency and storage, among other topics.\nReflection We learned a lot from this experience. For starters, guest lecturing on the week after reading week presents challenges with sustaining student involvement, particularly if the content is asynchronous and not associated with a gradebook item (such as a participation mark). More importantly, we developed this content fully aware that the Google Colab activity would engender some anxiety among students, specifically those not familiar with running or writing code. While we did not ask students to write new code, the appearance of unfamiliar syntax alone was enough to dissuade participation. Based on participation in the activity and classroom discussion, it looks like the Colab portion was a step too far for some students; however, several students successfully completed the notebook and reflected on the experience.\nIt is one thing to discuss change over time in the abstract and show three examples of change over time (as in the first activity), but quite another to analyze thousands of web pages and demonstrate change over time in a graphical form. What is clear is that we have not figured out how to bridge this technical gap quite yet. The issue may revolve around how content is presented. Nevertheless, a Colab environment is a promising proposition.\n","permalink":"https://brockdsl.github.io/archives_unleashed/posts/teaching-with-web-archives/","summary":"A summary of the in class activity held in conjunction with the project","title":"Teaching with Web Archives"},{"content":"Theory and Questions of the Archives Unleashed Niagara Region COVID-19 Dataset In this Archives Unleashed project, our team will be analyzing the Niagara Region COVID-19 dataset from the perspective of crisis communication theory. Crisis communication is a relatively young field by most standards, extending back just about 30 years. Back then, crisis communication researchers began with small-scale case studies of response messaging from individual organizations. The main question was this: Did the organization respond effectively to a crisis? If not, what could the organization have done better?\n\nToday, one trend in the field is towards computational analysis of very large datasets to go beyond the study of the individual organizational case. Looking at broader datasets can make eventual findings more significant – it’s not just one case. Our Niagara Region COVID-19 dataset is so big – gigabytes of website and social media data from many regional organizations – that computational analysis allows us to deal with and examine crisis messaging more systematically and on a broader scale. This analysis allows us to ask all kinds of important questions of the dataset and come to new, significant conclusions that further crisis communication theory. In turn, we hope practitioners can use these findings to deal effectively with the next mega crisis.\n\nBut first we have to ask questions that link past crisis communication theory with our dataset. Past research in the field on these mega crises falls into a few main themes:\n how crisis communication messaging contributes to community resilience; the development of public trust; education about and compliance with public health recommendations; public engagement with organizations. Researchers have also considered the factor of emotions in public messaging and messaging consistency and congruence during mega crises.   With these themes in mind, here are some of the questions we’re thinking about asking of the Niagara Region COVID-19 dataset:\n  Did private and public Niagara Region organizations communicate similar messages and advice to the public during the pandemic? Was there “one voice” across the region or diverging voices?\n  Was the purpose of communication instructional or emotional?\n  If the messages were instructional, were the instructions consistent across organizations (re. masking, social distancing, vaccination etc.)?\n  Did organizational messaging change over time in terms of content and emotional sentiment?\n  Were messages to the public simple or complicated?\n  How much of the message content was about organizational status versus community building?\n  Did organizations foreground messages from their leaders? Or did they speak as a ‘faceless’ organization?\n  Did organizations tell stories about the pandemic or just stick to the facts about COVID-19?\n  Did the emotions of the messages change over time, reflecting developments in the pandemic?\n  \nThese questions are exploratory in nature and quite broad at this time. But in the near future, as we start to dig into the dataset, we’ll be able to determine whether the questions can be answered at all. Most likely, computational analysis will favour some questions over others, and we can start moving more fully in a few of these directions. And those findings should provide some interesting, useful guidance for public relations practitioners, perhaps even as the pandemic continues into the winter of 2022.\n\nDuncan Koerber is the author of Crisis Communication in Canada published by University of Toronto Press, and is available in the Brock Library Collection\n ","permalink":"https://brockdsl.github.io/archives_unleashed/posts/crisis-communication-theory/","summary":"An introduction to crisis communication and how it relates to the Niagara COVID-19 archive","title":"Crisis Communication Theory and Questions"},{"content":"The COVID-19 in Niagara Dataset Traditionally in the archival profession, records arrive in archives when they are no longer an active part of the day-to-day functions or needs of the creator. The materials still have informational, evidentiary, or historic value. Thus, these need to be preserved for long term access. Most often, such records come to the archives years after their active life. In today’s digital world, records can change quickly – day to day, even hour by hour. The need to capture and store this information effectively for future reference and study is important.\nWhen the COVID-19 outbreak came to Canada in mid-March 2020, websites became one of the primary sources for information about the virus. The messaging and reactions surrounding COVID-19 seemed to change daily. In April 2020, the Brock University Archives started to capture COVID-19 related webpages of major municipal governments, businesses, and organizations in the Niagara region of Canada using the web archiving tool Archive-It in an effort to save the evolving record of this area’s response to this historic pandemic.\nWe identified 56 key local institutions, governments, and organizations that needed to communicate their pandemic related messages to their clients, constituents, and patrons often. Each of these groups created a COVID-19 webpage on their websites. These webpages have been crawled and saved using Archive-It weekly since April 2020. Our intention is to continue to do so through the duration of all pandemic measures surrounding COVID-19. As of this writing, there has been over 3.3 million documents saved equaling 301 GB of data. Here are some samples:\nTo supplement this information, we have also collected local news stories about the pandemic.\nBecause Archive-It is a paid subscription service, there is a cap on the amount of allotted storage space that Brock gets every year. To manage our allotment, most of these webpages were captured at either the One Page or One Page+ setting depending on the amount of data the creator placed on their websites weekly. For the One Page setting, hyperlinks within the page may not lead to another webpage. For One Page+, the first page as well as the first page of any URLs directly linked off of your seed was archived. We also set a data limit to each webpage to ensure that a few content heavy webpages would not use all the storage space at the detriment of the rest. At the start of the pandemic, the weekly capture of information ranged from 5 - 11 GB. Since October 2020, the average has settled to 2 -3 GB per week.\nAfter managing this dataset over the past year and a half, I cannot wait to see the discoveries that lie within and the fine research that will be done.\n","permalink":"https://brockdsl.github.io/archives_unleashed/posts/the-dataset/","summary":"A brief overview of the dataset we are using","title":"The Dataset"},{"content":"The Project This website is dedicated to documenting the progress of the Brock University team as they work through the Archives Unleashed Cohort program.
